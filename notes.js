//Change to instance mode and add import statements.
//
//Organize this code a little better and then...
//..Write a simple hierarchy of the most basic classes that I need.
//addEvenColumn needs to be a class. 




//There can be simple yet limited as well as complex yet robust versions of various functions. 
//addRow, addColumn, spreadRow, spreadColumn, starburst, staircase, 
//evenRow, and evenColumn, 
//Versions of these that take different combinations of variables but do similar things.
//Make a list of what type of objects and arguments each of these need.
//Do they need an object or just the list of arguments?
//Set up all so that it has default values for all of the arguments if they aren't passed in.
//
//Abstract out the colors into description names: main, mainRed, mainBlue, etc...
//
//I could also just hard-code an object and args to pass into addBalls and then give that a wrapper function name to access it again.
//Maybe I should build all of them this way... Probably, yes.
//Also, make a singular addBall function...
//
//Have another setTimeout which oscillates over the balls and background and makes subtle color adjustments.
